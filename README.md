## Overview

This repository contains MATLAB scripts that demonstrate different image processing techniques and filters. These scripts can be used to manipulate images using various filters such as Gaussian blur, edge detection, and grayscale conversion.

## Installation

To run these scripts, ensure you have MATLAB installed on your system. Clone this repository using the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
```

## Usage

1. Navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository.
2. Open MATLAB and run the scripts directly from the MATLAB command window or editor.
3. Follow the prompts or edit the scripts to process your own images.

## Image Filters

The following image filters are implemented in this project:

- **Gaussian Blur:** Smooths the image using a Gaussian kernel.
- **Edge Detection:** Detects edges in the image using Sobel or Canny edge detectors.
- **Grayscale Conversion:** Converts a color image to grayscale.

Each filter is implemented in its respective MATLAB script (`gaussian_blur.m`, `edge_detection.m`, `grayscale_conversion.m`). Detailed explanations and usage instructions are provided within each script file.

## Screenshots

Include screenshots of the input images and the output images after applying each filter. These screenshots can help demonstrate the effectiveness of each filter. Insert them below:
